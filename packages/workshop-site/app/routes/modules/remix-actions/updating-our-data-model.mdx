## Updating Our Data Model

Just like Remix can get data with `Loaders`, it can modify data through
`Actions`. As before, in order to get started we need to update our model to
support modification.

### Creating New Authors

In the last section we created an example function to get an author. This time
lets create an author.

<CodeBlock
  text={`
export function createAuthor(name: string, email: string) {
  await prisma.user.create({
    data: {
      name,
      email,
    }
  });
}

`} language="TypeScript" showLineNumbers={false} theme={dracula} />

<br />

### Other Mutations

You might be wondering how we can do other mutations to our data, like updates
and deletes. We could totally write more functions to support that, but that's
not the point of this section.

The takeaway is that we can use models, or really any code running on our Remix
server, to edit our data. Maybe you aren't even modifying persisted data!
Nothing is stopping you from updating an in-memory cache, reading the file
system, or emitting events. Anything you would normally do on the server is
still possible with Remix.

Let's look at how to post that `name` and `email` in the above example.

import { Link } from '@remix-run/react';

<div className="button-group">
  <Link to="/modules/remix-loaders/exercise">
    <button>Exercise</button>
  </Link>

  <Link to="/modules/remix-actions/building-a-form">
    <button>Building a Form</button>
  </Link>
</div>
