## Exercise: Remix Actions

Our last exercise! Let's get a couple actions created!

Under `exercise/remix-actions` there are starter files. Two routes exist, one
for a machines list and one for creating machines. You have markup ready for
you. Your task is to make those pages functional!

- Under `routes/machines.create.tsx` add an action that takes the `name` and
  `model` from the form. Create a machine through the `machine model` and then
  `redirect` to the `/machines` route. Your new machine should appear!

- Under `routes/machines` add a delete button to each machine list item. It
  should call an action to delete the machine, but we stay on the same page!
