## Exercise: Remix Loaders

Let's create a couple loaders for ourselves! Hopefully you'll see the advantage
of fetching and rendering on the server!

Under the `exercises/remix-loaders` folder there's some boilerplate code. We now
have a database and tailwindcss added to our project.

For this exercise, we need to focus on the `/app/models/machine` and
`/app/routes` files.

- Under the machine model, create two new functions. First, `getMachines` should
  retrieve all the machines in the database. Then `getMachine(id: number)`
  should get a specific machine. The
  [prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/crud)
  might be helpful here!

- The `/app/routes/machines` route should have a loader that gets all the
  machines and renders their names.

- The `/app/routes/machines.$machineId` route should get the `machineId` param
  in the loader and only display the name of that machine. (This naming
  convention is how you create nested routes without nested layouts!)
