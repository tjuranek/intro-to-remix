## Defining a Loader

The route modules we defined in the last section are capable of more than just
default exports of the JSX you want to render. We can also export a `loader`.
It's a named export that gets called before the JSX is rendered on the server.

The loaders correlate to GET requests to that route. We can query data on the
server in these functions and return it as json. Let's see a couple examples:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
import { getAuthors } from '~/models/author';

export async function loader() {
  const authors = await getAuthors();
  return json({ authors });
}

`} language="TypeScript" showLineNumbers={false} theme={dracula} />

<br />

Above is a basic loader that retrieves the authors from the database. **This
always happens on the server.** The response has an OK (200) status with a body
that contains a json object with the authors.

Let's look at a little bit of a more complex example:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
export async function loader(params) {
  const { authorId, bookId } = params;
  const author = getAuthor(authorId);
  const book = getBook(bookId);
  return json({ author, book }); 
}

`} language="TypeScript" showLineNumbers={false} theme={dracula} />

<br />

This gets the `$authorId` and `$bookId` from the path and uses them to fetch
data. We then return both items.

What if we wanted to display that data though?

import { Link } from '@remix-run/react';

<div className="button-group">
  <Link to="/modules/remix-loader/building-a-data-model">
    <button>Building a Data Model</button>
  </Link>

  <Link to="/modules/remix-loaders/rendering-data">
    <button>Rendering Data</button>
  </Link>
</div>
