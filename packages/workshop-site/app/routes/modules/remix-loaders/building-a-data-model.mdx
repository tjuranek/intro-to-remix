## Building a Data Model

Pretty much every web application needs to retrieve data. Remix has an
opinionated way to do that through `Loaders`.

Before we can effectively show a loader there needs to be data to fetch! A
popular way to interact with a database in JavaScript applications is `prisma`.
It's a Node.js and Typescript ORM that makes querying easy.

The setup for prisma isn't important for this workshop - lets get right to
querying data.

### Server Side Code in Remix

Remix runs in Node. We have all the flexibility that server side JavaScript
gives us available when a request to your Remix server comes in.

It's important to understand this. We're running a server rendered application.
Remix takes care of the routing for us, but what happens when a request comes in
is up to us.

Let's make a model that would let us query a list of authors from our prisma
client.

### Authors Model in Remix

We'll create a new `app/models` folder where we keep all our queries to our
database models. We want to export a function we can import into a Remix loader
later. It might look like this:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
export async function getAuthors() {
  return await prisma.authors.findMany();
}

`} language="TypeScript" showLineNumbers={false} theme={dracula} />

<br />

We're then able to import that function anywhere on our server.

<CodeBlock
  text={`
import { getAuthors } from '~/models/author';

`} language="TypeScript" showLineNumbers={false} theme={dracula} />

<br />

Since the only thing we return to the client is the result of our route this is
totally safe. The client doesn't have direct database access at all.

Let's see how we can call this `getAuthors` function from the Remix route.

import { Link } from '@remix-run/react';

<div className="button-group">
  <Link to="/modules/remix-routes/exercise">
    <button>Exercise</button>
  </Link>

  <Link to="/modules/remix-loaders/defining-a-loader">
    <button>Defining a Loader</button>
  </Link>
</div>
