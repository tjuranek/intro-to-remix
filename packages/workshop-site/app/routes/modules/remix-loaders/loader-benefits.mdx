## Loader Benefits

Other than being really easy to use, `Loaders` come with an awesome performance
advantage and a relieving DX advantage.

### Reviewing the Network Waterfall

Remember how I said pretty much everything in Remix revolves around routes? So
do loaders.

Because Remix knows **everything** that needs loaded just from the route, it can
kick off all the requests for that data at once. If we compare this to a
traditional SPA where requests are kicked off by client side JavaScript we see
much different network waterfalls.

Without Remix, requests initialize when the requesting components load. Our
client side bundle has to wait to render up stream before downstream requests
start. Again, Remix knows all loaders that need called just from the route.
Everything starts at once!

### State Management

Here's probably my favorite part of Remix. No more large client side state
objects to edit. All of the data on a page is hydrated in through loaders. Remix
keeps track of that state for you!

But what about updates? We'll see more in a bit, but Remix mutates data through
`<forms />` and will automatically revalidate state for you. Let's compare the
previous `getAuthors` loader call to something we're familiar with, like Redux.

First we need some state object:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
const state = { authors: [] }

`} language="typescript" showLineNumbers={false} theme={dracula} />

<br />

Then we need an action to set that state when data comes in:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
export function setAuthors(authors) {
  return { type: 'authors/SET', payload: { authors } }
}

`} language="typescript" showLineNumbers={false} theme={dracula} />

<br />

And then a reducer needs to accept that action and return a new state.

<CodeBlock
  text={`
export function reducer(state = {}, action = {}) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case: 'authors/SET':
      const newState = {
        authors: action.payload.authors
        ...state
      }
      return newState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

`} language="typescript" showLineNumbers={false} theme={dracula} />

<br />

That's three different blocks of code just to setup our state, invoke changes,
and handle actions. We have to do this for **every. single. action.**. We
haven't even touched how we handle asynchronous code with `redux-thunk` or
`redux-saga`!

Opting into an opinionated framework like Remix removes so much work and
complexity from our applications. Remix sticks to browser defaults with `fetch`
requests and uncomplicated re-validation when necessary.

Let's do an exercise where we try this out for ourselves.
