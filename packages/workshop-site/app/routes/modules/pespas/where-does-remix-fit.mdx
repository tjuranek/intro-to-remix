## Where Does Remix Fit?

`Remix` is the leading web framework to offer everything we just described from
a PESPA. It bridges the gap between the client and server. It's an opinionated
web framework with sensible defaults that stick to the platform in order to make
developing a great UI from the server very easy.

With Remix, the complexity behind routing, data fetching, data mutation, and
rendering is handled for us. It's smart about what needs to be loaded and
rendered - or revalidated after a mutation occurs.

Organizing our project in the predictable way Remix expects provides many
benefits. Remix has nested routing which makes route-based code splitting
possible. Loaders and actions provide predictable ways to handle data without
having to keep track of a client state. We see application performance and user
experience prioritized while also getting a great developer experience.

I myself have been really skeptical about frameworks in the past. I'm the type
of person who likes full control over the software I'm building and I want to
build features my way. The more I use Remix, the more I'm surpised at how
sensible the opinions it has actually are. I've never been able to get so much
done so quickly.

In the rest of this workshop I want to over the three most important features of
Remix:

- `Routing` (What's nested routing and why does it matter?)
- `Data Fetching` (How does fetching and rendering from the server benefit us?)
- `Data Mutation` (I'm familiar with my fetch requests and form libraries, do I
  really need to switch?)

Before we can dive into these three things, we need to get a project set up!
