### Progressively Enhanced Single Page App

That's what a Progressively Enhanced Single Page App is. Progressive enhancement
means we have a functional application even without Javascript, but more
importantly a simple structure to our application. They stick to browser basics
and smartly revalidate data in a way that doesn't require a full page reload and
keeps great UX a top priority.

Getting data is a breeze, the initial HTML is server rendered and JavaScript is
loaded to enhance the experience for user interactions. This is important -
**enahancement** not **enablement**.

Mutations happen through forms and routing corresponding requests to actions on
the server. After an action occurs, the router knows to revalidate data for the
current UI, or redirect to a new page.

**PESPA Pros:**

- Functionality is the baseline.
- JavaScript is for enhancement, not enablement.
- Lazy loading and smart pre-fetching is made easy.
- We write code for the server and hydrate updates to the browser.
- Using the platform is the default. The browser can do a lot!

<br />

**PESPA Cons:**

- Rendering on the server comes with its own set of challenges compared to
  client side rendering. Not everything in the browser is available on the
  server!
- Limited framework support at the time of this workshop.
- Edge cases can cause more complexity compared to MPAs or SPAs.
- Static generation is not a possibility.

So, this sounds cool. We get the simplicity benefits of keeping things on the
server, but instead of full page refreshes when mutations occur, we get updates
streamed from the server to the client. This enables us to maintain the high
quality UI that users expect nowadays.

But how does Remix fit into this?
