## Nested Layouts

It's very common to share layouts between different routes in web applications.
Take this workshop site for example! The main page has a unique layout, but
everything under `/modules` path uses a layout with a menu and sidebar.

You might think I created a layout component and then used that on every route,
but you'd be wrong. Remix makes it even easier with Nested Layouts. The best way
to explain this is to show it.

This is the route hierarchy of this website:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
    app
    -- modules
    -- -- introduction (/modules/introduction)
    -- -- -- prerequisites.mdx (/modules/introduction/prerequisites)
    -- -- -- ...
    -- -- ...
    -- index.tsx (/)
    -- modules.tsx (/modules)
  `}
  showLineNumbers={false}
  theme={dracula}
/>

<br />

Ignore the `.mdx` extension. Remix can turn markdown files into routes. The
focus here is that I have a modules base route, then a modules folder with
different routes under that.

The `modules.tsx` file defines the layout I want every route under `/modules`
folder to use. I can control where I want my subroutes to render in the layout
using a Remix component called `<Outlet />`. It means the rest of the route will
render in that specific section. Here's a basic example:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
    return (
      <div className="layout">
        <div className="menu" />
        <div className="sidebar" />
        <div className="content">
          <Outlet />
        </div>
      </div>
    )

`} language='TypeScript' showLineNumbers={false} theme={dracula} />

<br />

Anything that is a nested route below this `/modules` path will get rendered in
the `<Outlet />`. Right now you're seeing my markdown pages get rendered in the
`<Outlet />` of my `/modules` nested layout. Pretty cool, right?

<br />

We went over a lot, but I hope it shows that routing in Remix is really
powerful. Let's do an exercise to put everything together.

import { Link } from '@remix-run/react';

<div className="button-group">
  <Link to="/modules/remix-routes/route-params">
    <button>Route Params</button>
  </Link>

  <Link to="/modules/remix-routes/exercise">
    <button>Exercise</button>
  </Link>
</div>
