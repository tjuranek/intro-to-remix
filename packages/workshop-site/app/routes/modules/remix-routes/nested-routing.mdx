## Nested Routing

As we just learned, routing in Remix is based on the `file hierarchy` you define
your routes under. If you wanted to create multiples levels to your path you'd
create a folder and put more routes under it.

If we wanted to create a page for an individual author of a book, we might want
that path to be `/authors/georgeorwell`. The corresponding file structure would
be:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
    app
    -- routes
    -- -- authors
    -- -- -- georgeorwell.jsx (/authors/georgeorwell)
    -- -- index.jsx (/)
  `}
  showLineNumbers={false}
  theme={dracula}
/>

<br />

Nesting routes in a file heirarchy like this is known as `nested routing`. We're
able to create all of our paths and pages exclusively determined by where in the
file system the corresponding file is.

We didn't have to define a router or import all of our pages into a single file
to register them with the router. I'm especially happy we don't have to write
our own function for generating routes either.

As you can imagine, we could express many routes under many files very easily:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
    app
    -- routes
    -- -- authors
    -- -- -- index.jsx (/authors)
    -- -- -- $author.jsx (/authors/$author)
    -- -- index.jsx (/)
    -- -- login.jsx (/login)
    -- -- logout.jsx (/logout)
  `}
  showLineNumbers={false}
  theme={dracula}
/>

<br />

So this is sweet, without any code we're defining routes and associating them to
paths. But what's that `$author` thing above?

import { Link } from '@remix-run/react';

<div className="button-group">
  <Link to="/modules/remix-routes/defining-a-route">
    <button>Defining a Route</button>
  </Link>

  <Link to="/modules/remix-routes/route-params">
    <button>Route Params</button>
  </Link>
</div>
