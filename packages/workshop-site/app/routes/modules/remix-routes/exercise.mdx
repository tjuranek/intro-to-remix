## Exercise: Remix Routes

Time for our next exercise! Let's create our own routes!

Under the `exercies/remix-routes` folder in the workshop repository you'll find
a boilerplate Remix application. It's just the default one created by
`create-remix`.

Under `/app/routes` there is just one route - the index route.

Let's do a few things to try out what we just learned:

- Create a new `/machines` route that just renders a heading saying "Machines".
- Add a sidebar and content section for the machines pages as a new layout. The
  CSS classes under `/styles/global.css` are available to you on any route!
- Setup a new `/machines/$machineId` route that displays the value of the passed
  `machineId` in the content section.

If you get stuck, the answers are in the `answers/remix-routes` folder.

import { Link } from '@remix-run/react';

<div className="button-group">
  <Link to="/modules/remix-routes/nested-layouts">
    <button>Nested Layouts</button>
  </Link>

  <Link to="/modules/remix-loaders/building-a-data-model">
    <button>Building a Data Model</button>
  </Link>
</div>
