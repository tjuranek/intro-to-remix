## Route Params

Remix makes identifing segments of the path as parameters simple. By using the
`$` sybmol we can name parts of the path with custom variable names.

`/authors/$author` will have the `author` variable available on the request.
`/authors/$author/$book` will have both `author` and `book`.

These params are available either in `Loaders` (which we cover in the next
section) or on the `useParams` hook!

<CodeBlock
  text={`
  return function AuthorRoute() {
    const { author } = useParams();
    return <p>{author}</p>
  }
`}
  showLineNumbers={false}
  language="TypeScript"
  theme={dracula}
/>

One additional part of routing in Remix we haven't talked about yet is layouts!

import { Link } from '@remix-run/react';

<div className="button-group">
  <Link to="/modules/remix-routes/nested-routing">
    <button>Nested Routing</button>
  </Link>

  <Link to="/modules/remix-routes/nested-layouts">
    <button>Nested Layouts</button>
  </Link>
</div>
