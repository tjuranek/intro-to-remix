## Defining a Route

Routing is possibly the most powerful and important feature in Remix. Everything
starts with routes from your compiler to user interaction.

<br />

### Terminology

It's important we're on the same page about what a route is versus a path.

A route in Remix is a `JavaScript module` with some predictable exports that
corresponds to a specific path - or segment of the URL. For example, `/posts` is
a `path` that would correlate to the `Posts` route.

<br />

### Defining a Route

The default location for all routes in Remix is the `app/routes` folder. We can
define a new route by creating a new file - which would be a JavaScript module -
and exporting a `default` function from it.

The only requirement of this default function is that it must return the JSX
you'd like to render at that route. As you can imagine, that might be a very
basic block of code:

<CodeBlock
  text={`
  export default function SomeRouteName() {
    return <p>This text shows up on the page!</p>
  }

`} showLineNumbers={false} theme={dracula} language="TypeScript" />

<br />

You can treat this function like pretty much any other React component. Add UI
by importing other components or initialize some hooks.

Define multiple routes by creating multiple files under the `app/routes` folder.
The `index` route would map to the `/` path in your url. A `login.tsx` file
would correspond to the `/login` path. Your folder structure would look like
this:

<br />

<CodeBlock
  text={`
    app
    -- routes
    -- -- index.jsx (/)
    -- -- login.jsx (/login) 
  `}
  showLineNumbers={false}
  theme={dracula}
/>

<br />

But what if I wanted to create more specific routes under multiple paths?

import { Link } from '@remix-run/react';

<div className="button-group">
  <Link to="/modules/creating-a-remix-app/exercise">
    <button>Exercise</button>
  </Link>

  <Link to="/modules/remix-routes/nested-routing">
    <button>Nested Routing</button>
  </Link>
</div>
