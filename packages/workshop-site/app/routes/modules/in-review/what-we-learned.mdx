## What We Learned

You made it! We're done! We covered a lot of information about Remix - let's
recap.

<br />

### PESPAs

- Progressively Enhanced Single Page Apps
- They bring simplicity and a great user experience, and arguably a better
  developer experience.
- Remix bridges the client/server gap.

<br />

### Creating a Remix App

- The CLI has great tools to scaffold apps quickly.
- Offically supported stacks target different environments and are production
  ready.

<br />

### Remix Routes

- They're central to everything in Remix.
- The file system hierarchy defines routes, nested routes, and nested layouts.
- We can easily accept params in the url.

<br />

### Remix Loaders

- We run code to access persisted data on the server - the client can't access
  it.
- Loaders let us query that data and render it into routes.
- The network waterfall is significantly improved because Remix knows what needs
  loaded from the route.
- Large client side state management solutions are no longer necessary.

<br />

### Remix Actions

- Code to mutate data stays on the server.
- Actions accept form data and re-hydrate after submission.
- Forms remove all the input handlers from React and keep things handled by the
  browser.
