## Thanks for Attending!

There's a lot more I'd like to show off about Remix, including:

- Pending UI
- Optimistic UI
- Error Handling
- Non-nav Mutations
- Focus Management
- Declarative Revalidation
- Non-nav Fetching
- Imperative Mutations
- Skeletons
- Defer API
- Suspense

<br />

But I just don't have enough time to do so. If you're interested in future
workshops to cover these cases let me know!

### Questions?

If you have questions now is the time to ask! A few suggested topics:

- Next.js vs Remix
- Testing Remix Apps
- Demoing Other Remix Apps
