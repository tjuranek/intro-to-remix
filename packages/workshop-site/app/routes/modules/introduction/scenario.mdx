## Scenario

Let's put ourselves in the situation of a potential AWS IoT customer. They want
to build a custom application that extends AWS IoT functionality.

You've read a little bit about `Remix` on Twitter and various blogs. It sounds
like an effective way to get an application up and running quickly using the
JavaScript/React ecosystem. Your task is to learn the basics and be able to demo
them to your team.

Before we dive into learning what it is, let's take a look at why it exists and
what makes it different than the sites we're used to building.

import { Link } from '@remix-run/react';

<div className="button-group">
  <Link to="/modules/introduction/prerequisites">
    <button>Prerequisites</button>
  </Link>

  <Link to="/modules/pespas/short-history-of-web-architecture">
    <button>Short History of Web Architecture</button>
  </Link>
</div>
