import { CodeBlock, dracula } from 'react-code-blocks';

## Prerequisites

I'm excited you're taking this workshop! A couple of knowledge and system setup
items are required in order to effectively follow along.

<br />

### Getting the most out of this course

This workshop is _not_ intended for absolute beginners to web development. If
you haven't written JavaScript before it will be difficult to follow along.

We're going to be using TypeScript, React, and NodeJS pretty heavily. By no
means do you need to be an expert, but it's assumed you have experience.

<br />

### Dependencies

- `Git`: How code is pulled down and changed between modules.
- `NodeJS`: How the JavaScript is ran on your local machine. Version 16 or
  later.
- `NPM`: How we use external packages/dependencies, like Remix.

<br />

### Repository

You can clone the workshop repository by running the following:
