## Remix Stacks

`Remix Stacks` are pre-configured Remix applications that are ready for
deployment. The official stacks that are built into the CLI all include a
database, automatic deployment pipelines, authentication, testing, linting, and
code formatting.

There are currently three stacks available, the `Blues` stack, the `Indie`
stack, and the `Grunge` stack. They differ on a few things, but primarily
deployment targets and database type.

To get started with stacks run you add a `--template` flag with the desired
stack name to the `create-remix` package upon execution:

<CodeBlock
  text="npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/indie-stack my-project"
  showLineNumbers={false}
  theme={dracula}
/>

import { Link } from '@remix-run/react';
