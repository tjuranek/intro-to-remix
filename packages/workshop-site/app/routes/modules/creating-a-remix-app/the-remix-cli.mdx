## The Remix CLI

The `Remix CLI` comes from the `@remix-run/dev` package. It also includes the
compiler.

To get a Remix project created, you can execute the `create-remix` package. By
default it'll create a new project from scratch. When running the package you
will be walked through some project setup like TypeScript configuration and
deployment targets.

You can try this out with the `node package executer` - commonly known as `npx`.

<CodeBlock
  text="npx create-remix@latest my-project"
  showLineNumbers={false}
  theme={dracula}
/>

This is a great way to get a minimal configuration Remix application up and
running, but what if there was a way to use a templated Remix application that
are already configured for production use?
